  <p>
    I am SpaceMan , it's not my real name and i won't share it with the world because i don't think that there is a need to do that and there are already a lot of <a href="/blog/blog_privacy.html">privacy related issues</a> in the world.<br>
    <strong>I</strong> am not a programmer or a developer 
   , but this website was created by me (<i>I learnt some html and css</i>) and will continue it's development.
   <br><hr>
   <strong>Note:</strong> <p>I will also share links to my project in <a href="links.html">Links</a> page.</p>
